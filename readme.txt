----------------------------------------------------------------// Elliot Wanless//// Blackjack (UNFINISHED)----------------------------------------------------------------03/11/18- Created the main functions of the game; dealing cards, checking winners and allowing the player and dealer to draw more.- VECTORS are used for both player and dealer cards as they can be ‘pushed_back’.The current game allows for one play through but the user can’t do anything other than HIT and HOLD. NEXT STEPS:- DOUBLE (option = 2) has not yet been introduced, yet it would only double the current bet (if their balance allowed) and allow for ONE extra card to be drawn.- Introduce (option = 4) to SPLIT if the player has 10/10. Maybe if they have a picture card too.CURRENT PROBLEMS:- NONE as of 03/11/18----------------------------------------------------------------05/11/18- Double checked the current version.
